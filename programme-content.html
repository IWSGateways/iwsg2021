                            Cloud computing offers resources on-demand and without large capital investments. As such, it is extremely attractive to many industry and scientific application areas that require large computation and storage facilities and it has become the major computing resource behind current science gateways. However, many end users are still struggling to get the full benefits from using the elastic nature of the cloud. Major factors prohibiting wider take-up and efficient utilisation of cloud technologies include limited automated elasticity/scalability of resources at the level of cloud applications, fear of potential vendor lock-in by depending on one particular cloud technology, and increased security concerns imposed by the third party provisioning model and the technology itself. This keynote presentation will provide an overview of such challenges facing end users when utilising cloud resources via science gateways. Through the examples of current and recent European research projects it will present possible solutions for the problems of automated application deployment, dynamic scalability and enhanced security.

                            Tamas Kiss is a Professor of Distributed Computing at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Director of the Research Centre for Parallel Computing at the University of Westminster, and Editor in Chief of the Journal of Grid Computing published by Springer Nature. He has attracted over £30 Million research funding and has been leading national and European research projects related to scientific and enterprise applications of cloud computing technologies. He has been involved in the science gateway research community for over a decade and was a main contributor to the WS-PGRADE Science Gateway Framework and its related technologies. Ha has also chaired three previous IWSG workshops. Between 2013 and 2016 he acted as project director and scientific coordinator for the European CloudSME (Cloud-based Simulation Platform for Manufacturing and Engineering) project that developed a Cloud-based simulation solution for manufacturing and engineering SMEs. He is Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of CloudSME UG, a start-up that has been established by ten European stakeholders to exploit the results of the CloudSME project. Recently he led the EU H2020 COLA (Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application) project that investigated how a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications can be created. Currently, he is  a member of the Executive Board and Coordinator of Application Experiments in the EU H2020 CloudiFacturing (Cloudification of Production Engineering for Predictive Digital Manufacturing) project that brings and progresses advanced information and communications technology in the field of cloud-based modelling and simulation, data analytics for online factory data, and real-time support to European manufacturing SMEs. Since December 2018 he is also Project Coordinator for the EU H2020 ASCLEPIOS project that focuses on secure and scalable cloud applications in healthcare.

                                Virtual research environments are systems called to serve the needs of their designated communities of practice. Every community of practice is a group of people dynamically aggregated by the willingness to collaborate to address a given research question. The development of such a typology of system thus to guarantee its uptake from the community of practice is a challenging task. In this paper, we advocate how the co-creation driven approach promoted by D4Science proven to be effective. In particular, we present the co-creation options supported, discuss how these options have been exploited by diverse communities of practice and give some usage indicators on the so created VREs.

                                In order to increase the value of scientific datasets and improve research outcomes, it is important that only trust- worthy data is used. This paper introduces mechanisms by which scientists and the organisations they represent can certify the authenticity of characteristics and provenance of published datasets so that secondary users can inspect and gain confidence in the qualities of data sources. By drawing on data models and protocols emerging to provide self-sovereign ownership of identity and personal data to individuals, we conclude that providing self-sovereignty to digital assets offers a promising approach for institutions to certify qualities of their datasets in a cryptographically secure manner, and enables secondary data users to efficiently perform verification of the authenticity of such certifications. By building upon emerging standards for decentralized identification and cryptographically verifiable credentials, we envisage an infrastructure of interoperable tools being developed to foster improvements in the quality of infor- mation provided in support of shared data assets.

                                Science gateways are widely utilised in a range of scientific disciplines to provide user-friendly access to complex distributed computing infrastructures. The traditional approach in science gateway development is to concentrate on this simplified resource access and provide scientists with a graphical user interface to conduct their experiments and visualise the results. However, as user communities behind these gateways are growing and opening their doors to less experienced scientists or even to the general public as “citizen scientists”, there is an emerging need to extend these gateways with training and learning support capabilities. This paper describes a novel approach showing how science gateways can be extended with embedded e-learning support using an ontology-based learning environment called Knowledge Repository Exchange and Learning (KREL). The paper also presents a prototype implementation of a science gateway for analysing earthquake data and demonstrates how the KREL can extend this gateway with ontology-based embedded e- learning support.
