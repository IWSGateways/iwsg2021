                            Tamas Kiss is a Professor of Distributed Computing at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Director of the Research Centre for Parallel Computing at the University of Westminster, and Editor in Chief of the Journal of Grid Computing published by Springer Nature. He has attracted over £30 Million research funding and has been leading national and European research projects related to scientific and enterprise applications of cloud computing technologies. He has been involved in the science gateway research community for over a decade and was a main contributor to the WS-PGRADE Science Gateway Framework and its related technologies. Ha has also chaired three previous IWSG workshops. Between 2013 and 2016 he acted as project director and scientific coordinator for the European CloudSME (Cloud-based Simulation Platform for Manufacturing and Engineering) project that developed a Cloud-based simulation solution for manufacturing and engineering SMEs. He is Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of CloudSME UG, a start-up that has been established by ten European stakeholders to exploit the results of the CloudSME project. Recently he led the EU H2020 COLA (Cloud Orchestration at the Level of Application) project that investigated how a generic and pluggable framework that supports the optimal and secure deployment and run-time orchestration of cloud applications can be created. Currently, he is  a member of the Executive Board and Coordinator of Application Experiments in the EU H2020 CloudiFacturing (Cloudification of Production Engineering for Predictive Digital Manufacturing) project that brings and progresses advanced information and communications technology in the field of cloud-based modelling and simulation, data analytics for online factory data, and real-time support to European manufacturing SMEs. Since December 2018 he is also Project Coordinator for the EU H2020 ASCLEPIOS project that focuses on secure and scalable cloud applications in healthcare.
